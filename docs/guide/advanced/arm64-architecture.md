# ARM64 architecture

Over the last years, and especially thanks to Apple's chips, ARM64 architecture has become more and more popular.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has also released its own ARM64-based instances, which are cheaper and more efficient than their x86 (AMD64) counterparts: [the Graviton instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/).

**Magento / Adobe Commerce runs perfectly on ARM64 architecture**, and you can use the same deployment strategies as for x86 (AMD64) instances.

At the time of writing, all the tools and services used in this guide are compatible with ARM64 architecture.

However, you may need to check the compatibility of some third-party services or tools you use in your Magento / Adobe Commerce stack.
