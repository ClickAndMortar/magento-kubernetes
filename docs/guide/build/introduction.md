# Introduction

We'll be using Docker to build Magento / Adobe Commerce image, and run it in Kubernetes.

You need to have a Docker image/container registry available to push your images to. We'll be using [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com) in this guide.
Other popular options are:

* [AWS ECR](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/)
* [Google Cloud Container Registry](https://cloud.google.com/container-registry)
* [Azure Container Registry](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-registry/)
* [GitHub Container Registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-docker-registry)
* [GitLab Container Registry](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/packages/container_registry/)
